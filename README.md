# C++ Mini Project
This are few projects using C++ Programming Langauge.
<br>
The project includes few basics concepts and OOP's concepts.
<br><br>
# --> Simple ATM simulation (ATM.c++)
This C++ program simulates basic ATM operations, including checking your balance, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and transferring funds. It's a simple demonstration and does not represent a real ATM system. The program handles PIN validation and error messages and allows users to perform transactions until they choose to exit. Please note that this code is for educational purposes and should not be used in real-world applications.

# --> Simple C++ Digital Clock Display(digit_clock)
This C++ program, titled "Simple C++ Digital Clock Display," allows users to input hours, minutes, and seconds and displays the time according to the 24-hour clock format. It checks for valid input and provides formatted output. This code can serve as a basic example for handling time-related operations in C++. Enjoy using it for your projects!

# --> Simple User Management System(registratio_form.c++)
This is a simple console-based User Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to register, login, view a list of users, search for users, and delete users. Users' information, including usernames and passwords, is stored in memory. This project is a basic example of user management and can be used as a starting point for more complex applications. Feel free to use and modify it as needed.
