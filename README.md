# --> Simple ATM simulation (ATM.c++)
This C++ program simulates basic ATM operations, including checking your balance, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and transferring funds. It's a simple demonstration and does not represent a real ATM system. The program handles PIN validation and error messages and allows users to perform transactions until they choose to exit. Please note that this code is for educational purposes and should not be used in real-world applications.
